#  Mexico Plans to Build Wall to Keep Out Casino Blackjack 

Mexico is looking to build a wall along its border with Guatemala in an attempt to keep out blackjack casino players.

The proposed wall, which will cost an estimated $8 billion, will be made of reinforced concrete and stand nearly 40 feet high. It will also have electric fencing and motion detectors.

President Enrique Peña Nieto says the wall is necessary to protect Mexico's economy. "Our country cannot afford to lose billions of dollars every year to blackjack casino players," he said.

The project has met with opposition from both the Mexican and Guatemalan governments. "This is an insult to our people," said Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales.

Opponents argue that the wall will do nothing to stop blackjack casino players and will instead cause more problems than it solves. "It's a waste of money," said Mexican Senator Armando Rios Piter. "And it's going to further damage our relationship with Guatemala."

Another popular variant of blackjack in Mexico is called “punto banco”. This game is also played with eight decks of cards and you can only bet on the dealer’s hand. If you get closer to 21 points than the dealer, then you win!

#  Mexican Casinos Seeing Increased Business from Casino Blackjack

As the legalization of casino gambling has swept across North America, casino businesses in Mexico have seen a surge in profits. The main attraction of these casinos is blackjack, which is becoming increasingly popular with Mexican players.

Part of the reason for this surge in business is that blackjack offers better odds for gamblers than other casino games such as roulette or slots. In addition, many Mexican players are attracted to the social atmosphere of blackjack tables, where they can chat and interact with other players.

While there are some smaller casinos that do not offer blackjack, the majority of casinos in Mexico now offer the game. In fact, many casinos have added new blackjack tables in order to meet the increasing demand from players.

The popularity of blackjack in Mexican casinos has even led to the development of special blackjack variants that are unique to this region. For example, one variant called “blackjack zero” features a bonus payout for hand totals of 21 achieved using all natural cards (an Ace and a two through 10).

Overall, the increasing popularity of casino gambling in Mexico is benefiting casino businesses tremendously. Blackjack is currently by far the most popular game among Mexican players, and this looks likely to continue into the future.
