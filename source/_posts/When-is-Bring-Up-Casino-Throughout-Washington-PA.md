#  What are the Chances of a Casino Coming to Washington PA?

There has been a great deal of discussion in recent months about the potential for a casino to be built in Washington PA. Proponents of the idea believe that it would bring much-needed jobs and economic development to the region, while opponents argue that a casino would have negative consequences for the community. So what are the chances of a casino coming to Washington PA?

To answer that question, we first need to take a look at the current landscape for casinos in Pennsylvania. There are currently 11 casinos operating in the state, and another is under construction. So there is certainly room for another casino in Pennsylvania, but it’s not clear that Washington PA is the best location for it.

The most likely candidate for a new casino in Pennsylvania is Pittsburgh, which is currently without one. The other contenders include Philadelphia, Erie, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The main factor that will determine whether a casino comes to Washington PA or not is likely to be population size – Pittsburgh has a population of more than 300,000, while Washington PA has less than 10,000.

So while there is certainly potential for a casino to come to Washington PA, it’s not likely to be at the top of the list when compared to other locations in Pennsylvania.
