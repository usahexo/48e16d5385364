#  What is the main difference between Tombola and Betzest? 

Tombola and Betzest are two of the most popular online gambling platforms in the world. They offer a variety of games and betting options to their users. However, there are some key differences between the two platforms that set them apart. 

The first difference is that Tombola is a British company, while Betzest is a Dutch company. This means that the games offered by each platform are different. Tombola focuses mainly on bingo games, while Betzest offers a wider range of games, including slots, casino games, and sports betting. 

Another difference is that Tombola is licensed by the UK Gambling Commission, while Betzest is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority. This means that Betzest is able to accept players from a wider range of countries than Tombola. Tombola is only available to players from the UK and Ireland. 

Finally, Betzest offers a much wider range of betting options than Tombola. Tombola only allows you to bet on bingo games, while Betzest lets you bet on a wide variety of sports events as well as casino and slot games. This gives Betzest an advantage over Tombola when it comes to betting options. 

Overall, these differences mean that Betzest is a better option than Tombola for online gambling enthusiasts. It offers a more diverse selection of games and betting options, and it is available to players from more countries.

#  Do you have to be a resident of a certain country to participate in Tombola? 

There is no residency requirement to play Tombola, so anyone from anywhere in the world can join and have a chance to win. This international appeal is part of what makes Tombola so popular, with players from all over the globe competing for the top prizes.

#  Are there any secret bonus codes for Tombola that can give players an edge?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as the bonus codes that Tombola offers players change on a regular basis. However, there are some bonus codes that may be worth trying if you're looking to up your chances of winning.

For example, the code 'WINNER' is often offered as a bonus code, and gives players the chance to win an extra £5 when they first sign up to the site. Similarly, the code 'FREESPIN' can give players 10 free spins on the Tombola slot game.

Players can also take advantage of bonus codes that offer them free tickets into prize draws. The code 'DRAW' for example, gives players the chance to enter a prize draw where they could win a holiday or cash prize. So it's always worth checking Tombola's website or social media pages for the latest bonus codes and see if there's one that could work in your favour.

#  How often do new games get released on the Tombola platform? 

In Tombola’s history, there have been over 1,500 games released on the platform. This averages out to about 10 new games released every day. However, this number varies depending on the time of year. In January for example, we see an increase in game releases as developers rush to get their games launched before the New Year. Conversely, in December there are usually fewer game releases as many developers take a break during the holiday season.
