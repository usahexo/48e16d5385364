#  In Which Casino Did Casino Royale Take Place?

One of the most common questions about the James Bond movie Casino Royale is in which casino did it take place? The answer is a little complicated.

The movie was actually filmed at two different casinos. The exterior shots were done at the Czech Republic's Barrandov Studios, and the interior scenes were done at the Spielbank Baden-Baden in Germany.

Bond himself even says in the movie that the action is taking place in two different countries. When he's talking to Vesper on the phone, he says, "The name's Bond. James Bond." She responds, "And I am Miss Moneypenny." To which he replies, "The USA and UK are not that far apart."

So if you're looking for the exact casino where Casino Royale took place, it would be a bit of a stretch to say either one. However, if you're just looking for a fun spot to visit and experience some of what Bond went through, then both casinos are definitely worth checking out!

#  Casino Royale Location: In Which Casino Did It Happen?

Casino Royale is the name of the very first James Bond novel, as well as the film adaptation of it. The novel was written by Ian Fleming and first published in 1953. The movie was released in 2006 and starred Daniel Craig in his debut as James Bond.

The story of Casino Royale is set at the fictional Casino Royale in Montenegro. However, there is some debate as to which casino this actually refers to. Fleming never mentioned an exact casino, instead referring to it only as “a small, Eastern European country”.

There are a few likely contenders for the casino’s real-life location. One possibility is that it was based on the Casino Municipale di Venezia in Venice, Italy. This casino has a long and colourful history, dating back to 1638 when it first opened its doors. It is also said that Fleming himself visited the casino on several occasions.

Another contender is the Orio al Serio International Airport in Bergamo, Italy. This airport has a casino built right into it, which opened in 2005 – just a year before Casino Royale hit the big screens. It’s possible that Fleming got wind of this new development and used it as inspiration for his story.

So, which casino was actually used as the model for Casino Royale? That remains a mystery to this day!

The location provided an idyllic setting for the showdown between the two characters, and helped to make the scene all the more thrilling. Today, the villa remains a popular tourist attraction for Bond fans from all over the world.
