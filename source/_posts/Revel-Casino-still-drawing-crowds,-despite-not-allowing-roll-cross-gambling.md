#  Revel Casino still drawing crowds, despite not allowing roll cross gambling

When Revel Casino first opened, it was all the rage. People were drawn to its luxurious feel and the promise of gambling with no roll cross restrictions. However, recently the casino has come under fire for changing its policy on roll cross gambling and now people are choosing to go elsewhere.

Despite this change, Revel Casino is still seeing a steady stream of visitors. Many people are simply unaware of the policy change, while others are choosing to ignore it and hope that things will change in the future. There are also some people who are choosing to stay at Revel Casino because they feel that it offers a better overall experience than other casinos in the area.

So far, Revel Casino’s policy change has not had a major impact on business. The casino is still seeing plenty of visitors and is generating a healthy amount of revenue. However, if the trend continues, it is likely that Revel Casino’s profits will start to decline in the near future.

#  Despite financial struggles, Revel Casino continues to draw visitors

The Revel Casino has been open for just over a year, and it has been anything but a success. The casino has had to file for bankruptcy twice in that time, and just recently announced that it would be closing its doors in September.

Even with these financial struggles, the Revel Casino continues to draw visitors. This is testament to the casino's impressive design and amenities. The casino is situated on the Atlantic City Boardwalk, and features beautiful views of the ocean. It also boasts a wide variety of restaurants and shops, as well as two nightclubs and a spa.

The Revel Casino is not cheap, however. Rooms start at $229 per night, which is more than most other casinos in Atlantic City. There are also no promotional or discount offers available. So why do people continue to visit the Revel Casino?

One reason may be that the Revel Casino is one of the few casinos in Atlantic City that still offers live table games. Most other casinos have switched to electronic versions, which can be less fun and more confusing for some players. The Revel Casino also offers a wide variety of slot machines, which is another attraction for many visitors.

Despite its financial troubles, the Revel Casino remains an impressive destination for vacationers looking for a unique experience.
