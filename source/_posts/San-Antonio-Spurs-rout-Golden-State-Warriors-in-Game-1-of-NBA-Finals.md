#  San Antonio Spurs rout Golden State Warriors in Game 1 of NBA Finals

In a lopsided matchup, the San Antonio Spurs dominated the Golden State Warriors in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, 109-91. The Spurs got off to a hot start, scoring 34 points in the first quarter while holding the Warriors to 18. They never looked back, cruising to an easy victory.

 Kawhi Leonard led the way for San Antonio with 29 points and 10 rebounds, while LaMarcus Aldridge added 18 points and 10 rebounds. Stephen Curry led Golden State with 25 points on 8-for-21 shooting, but was largely ineffective against the Spursâ€™ stout defense. Klay Thompson was the only other Warrior to score in double figures, with 14 points.

The Spurs were incredibly efficient offensively, shooting 53 percent from the field and 46 percent from three-point range. They also outrebounded Golden State 49-35 and had 24 assists compared to just nine turnovers.

This was a convincing victory for San Antonio, and it looks like they may be too much for the Warriors to handle in this series. Golden State will need to make some adjustments if they want to compete with the Spurs going forward.

#  San Antonio Spurs take commanding 2-0 lead over Golden State Warriors

Coming into the 2017 Western Conference Finals, many experts had Golden State as heavy favorites due to the injury some of San Antonio's key players. The Spurs have other plans.

Led by Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge, the Spurs have taken a commanding 2-0 lead in the series against the defending champions. Leonard has been virtually unguardable averaging 31 points on 62% shooting in addition to 8 rebounds and 3 assists per game. Aldridge has chipped in with 17 points and 8 rebounds per game.

The Warriors, led by Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Klay Thompson, have struggled to find their rhythm in this series. Durant is averaging 29 points on 50% shooting, but Curry and Thompson are both averaging below 20 points per game.

The Spurs will look to take a commanding 3-0 lead when they head to Golden State for Game 3 on Thursday night.
