The United States has a long history of gambling. From the days of the Wild West to modern times, people in America have enjoyed betting on games of chance. But what is gambling?

Gambling is defined as “a bet or wager on the outcome of a game or contest” (dictionary.com).

Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it can also be addictive and lead to financial ruin.

# 5. Congress moves to ban online gambling

Although online gambling was legalized in the United States in 2006, a new bill has been introduced in Congress that will outlaw the practice. The move by Congress is supported by the casino industry, which has long argued that online gambling is dangerous and addictive.

The bill, which was introduced by Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, would make it illegal for banks and credit card companies to process payments for online gambling transactions. It would also prohibit advertising of online gambling websites.

"The fact that you can sit in your living room in Utah and gamble on a casino game in Delaware is a crazy situation," Chaffetz said. "It's time to draw a line in the sand."

Opponents of the bill argue that it is unconstitutional and amounts to government overreach. They also say that it will be difficult to enforce, as people will still be able to gamble online using offshore websites.

Online gambling is estimated to be a $4 billion industry, with about half of that taking place in the United States.
