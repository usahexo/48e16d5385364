#  What is Rated Play?

Rated Play is a new feature on Steam that allows players to rate each other's games. This system is designed to help players find good games by providing feedback on how well other people have enjoyed a game.

The ratings are made up of a percentage score, and the user can leave a short review to explain why they liked or disliked the game. The score goes from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best rating.

Only games that have been released on Steam can be rated, and the player must own the game in order to rate it.

# How do I use Rated Play?

To use Rated Play, simply open the game's store page on Steam and look for the "Rate this game" button. Clicking this will take you to the ratings screen, where you can score the game and leave a review.

You can also access Rated Play from your profile page on Steam. Just click on "My ratings" in the side navigation bar and you'll be able to see all of your recent ratings.

#  How to Participate in Rated Play

A great way to improve your skills at Hearthstone is to participate in rated play. In this guide, we will go over how to participate in rated play and what you can expect from it.

To participate in rated play, you first need to have a deck that is ranked. You can either create a new deck or use one of your existing decks. Once you have a ranked deck, you need to select “play mode” and then click on the “ranked” button. This will take you to the ranked play lobby.

In the ranked play lobby, you will see several games that are currently in progress. You can also see the players who are currently in the game and the decks they are using. To join a game, simply click on the “join game” button next to the game that you want to join.

If there are no games available, you can create a new game by clicking on the “create game” button. This will allow you to choose the rank of your deck, the amount of players, and the format of the game. You can also choose whether or not you want to use card backs and emotes.

Once all of the players have joined, the game will start automatically. The person who creates the game is automatically assigned as the host. The host has several responsibilities including choosing a starting player, choosing a hero for each player, and banning cards.

The first player starts with two cards and draw one card each turn thereafter. The first player can also put down a taunt minion on their first turn if they have it available. If neither player has any minions after both players have had their turn, then the game is a draw.

When playing in a ranked game, there are several things that you need to keep in mind:

-Your goal is to win games so that you can increase your rank
-You cannot concede or forfeit games without penalty
-You must have a ranked deck in order to participate in rated play
-You must be at least level 20 in order to participate in rated play
