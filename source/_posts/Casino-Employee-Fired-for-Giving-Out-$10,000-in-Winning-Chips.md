#  Casino Employee Fired for Giving Out $10,000 in Winning Chips

It was a scene straight out of a movie. A casino employee was caught on camera giving out $10,000 in winning chips to two lucky players. As soon as the casino's management found out about the incident, the employee was fired immediately.

The manager of the casino issued a statement, saying that the employee's actions were "in direct violation of company policy and jeopardize the integrity of our gaming operation." The casino is currently investigating the matter to determine how the employee was able to get away with such a blatant act of fraud.

One of the players who received the chips allegedly said that he had no idea that they were stolen. He added that he planned to use them to pay off some bills and planned to return later in the week to play some more blackjack.

This isn't the first time that an employee has been caught stealing from a casino. In fact, there have been several instances of employees stealing small sums of money here and there. However, this is by far the largest amount that has been stolen by an employee.

In light of this incident, the casino has announced that it will be increasing its security measures to prevent similar occurrences from happening in the future. Security cameras will now be installed in all areas where chips are stored or exchanged, and employees will be subject to more frequent audits.
