#  Illegal Cars Seized in Ethiopia

Illegal vehicles have been confiscated by the Ethiopian government in an attempt to end the rampant smuggling of cars into the country.

The majority of the vehicles were seized in the capital city of Addis Ababa, where authorities have been cracking down on car imports in recent months.

Addis Ababa’s Customs and Revenue Authority revealed that it has seized over 1,000 vehicles that were brought into the country illegally. Of these, 994 were cars and the remainder were motorcycles.

Smugglers have been exploiting a weak spot in Ethiopia’s import regulations, which allow people to bring in used vehicles that are less than five years old. As a result, many cars that are being smuggled into Ethiopia are much older than this.

Authorities say that they are now investigating how these vehicles were brought into the country without paying any import duties or taxes. The smugglers could face fines or even imprisonment if they are found guilty of violating the law.

This crackdown on illegal car imports is part of a wider effort by the Ethiopian government to improve revenue collection. In recent years, Ethiopia has suffered from a significant shortfall in tax revenue due to weak economic growth and widespread tax evasion.

To address this issue, the government has been introducing new measures to improve tax compliance and boost revenue collection. These include a new value-added tax (VAT) system that came into effect in July 2018 and a crackdown on corruption.

#  Officials Cracking Down on Illegal Gambling in Wichita, Kansas

For years, Wichita, Kansas has been a hub for illegal gambling. But that may be changing. This week, local officials announced a crackdown on illegal gambling in the city.

“Illegal gambling is a scourge on our community,” said Wichita Mayor Jeff Longwell. “It hurts businesses and families, and we are going to do everything we can to stamp it out.”

City officials say they will be increasing patrols in areas known for illegal gambling, and they are also urging residents to report any suspicious activity.

“This is a fight that we are going to win,” Longwell said.

Illegal gambling includes activities such as backroom poker games, casino nights, and even betting on sports games. It is typically conducted in secret, making it difficult to track down and prosecute offenders.

But Wichita officials say they are ready to take on the challenge. They warn that anyone caught engaging in illegal gambling will face consequences, including fines and possible jail time.

#  Police Seize Cars from Illegal Gambling Ring in Ethiopia

Police have seized over 400 cars from an illegal gambling ring in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.

The seizure was part of a crackdown on the gambling ring, which has been in operation for several years.

Officials say that the cars were used to transport people and money between different gambling venues.

They also seized cash and other gambling equipment in the raid.

“This is a major blow to the illegal gaming industry in Addis Ababa,” said police spokesman Assefa Teklemawold.

“We will continue to crack down on this activity, which causes so much harm to society.”

Illegal gambling is a major problem in Ethiopia, where there are few legal options for betting.

Most of the gambling takes place in unlicensed venues, which often operate as fronts for organised crime networks.

#  ICE and Ethiopian Authorities Team Up to Combat Illicit Activity

On July 2, 2019, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Ethiopian Federal Police announced a new partnership to jointly combat illicit activity. The two agencies will exchange information, cooperate on investigations and training, and collaborate to disrupt transnational crime.

This new partnership is an important step in strengthening international cooperation to combat crime. The joint efforts of ICE and the Ethiopian Federal Police will help protect both countries’ citizens and economies from the harm caused by criminal activity.

Illicit activity can take many forms, including drug trafficking, human smuggling, money laundering, and terrorist financing. These activities can have devastating consequences for communities and businesses. By working together, ICE and the Ethiopian Federal Police can better identify and investigate perpetrators of these crimes, and bring them to justice.

The partnership between ICE and the Ethiopian Federal Police is also a sign of growing ties between the United States and Ethiopia. The two countries have worked together on a number of issues in recent years, including counterterrorism, trade, and development assistance. This new partnership builds on that foundation of cooperation and friendship.

#  Ethiopian Authorities Work with ICE to Seize Illegitimate Vehicles

On July 9, 2019, the Ethiopian authorities worked with ICE to seize illegitimate vehicles. The vehicles had been brought into the country without proper documentation or licensing.

This collaborative effort between the Ethiopian authorities and ICE underscores both agencies’ commitment to upholding the rule of law and combating illegal activity. The seizure of these unlicensed and undocumented vehicles will help to improve traffic safety and security in Ethiopia.

In addition to seizing the vehicles, the joint operation resulted in the arrest of several individuals believed to be involved in the smuggling enterprise. This demonstrates that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or status.

The success of this operation is a testament to the strong relationship between Ethiopia and ICE. We commend our partners in Ethiopia for their steadfast commitment to fighting crime and protecting public safety.
