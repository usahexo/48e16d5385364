#  German Soccer Club in Talks to Sell Revel Casino

The Revel Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, may have a new owner. German soccer club Bayer 04 Leverkusen is in talks to purchase the casino from its current owner, Glenn Straub.

The Revel Casino has been closed since September 2014 and has been through multiple owners since then. Straub acquired the casino for $82 million in February of 2015, but his plans to reopen it have failed.

Bayer 04 Leverkusen is a professional soccer club that plays in the Bundesliga, the top level of German soccer. The club is currently in 13th place in the league and is looking to invest in other properties to help expand their brand.

It is unclear how much Bayer 04 Leverkusen plans to pay for the Revel Casino, but Glenn Straub has stated that he is motivated to sell the property.

#  Mystery Billionaires Emerge as Owners of Revel Casino

The Revel Casino, Atlantic City's newest and most lavish gambling facility, has a new owner. But the identity of the new owner remains a mystery.

According to reports, the casino was sold last week to a group of mystery billionaires for $110 million. The sale comes just two months after Revel Casino filed for bankruptcy.

Revel Casino is a $2.4 billion project that opened its doors in April of 2012. But it has failed to turn a profit, largely due to competition from casinos in neighboring states.

So who are the new owners? No one knows for sure. But there are some theories.

Some people believe that the new owners are affiliated with Sheldon Adelson, the CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corporation. Adelson is known for his high-profile investments in casinos and other gaming ventures.

Others believe that the new owners may be affiliated with Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor who has made a fortune investing in distressed companies. Icahn is also known for his ownership stake in Tropicana Entertainment, which operates several casinos in Atlantic City.

Still others believe that the new owners may be a group of Russian oligarchs or Chinese investors. Or they could be anyone else who wants to keep their identity hidden.

Whoever they are, the new owners will have their work cut out for them if they hope to turn Revel Casino around. The casino is saddled with more than $1 billion in debt, and it faces strong competition from other gaming facilities in the region.

#  Wynn Resorts Makes Offer to Buy Revel Casino

Wynn Resorts is interested in buying Revel Casino, the Atlantic City casino that has been struggling since it opened in April.

John Weinberg, a representative for Wynn, said that the company has made an offer to purchase Revel, but he would not disclose the terms of the offer. Weinberg did say that the offer is "non-binding."

Revel officials released a statement saying that they are "reviewing the proposal and will respond in due course."

This is not the first time that Wynn has shown an interest in Revel. In July, Steve Wynn visited Revel and met with its officials. At the time, Wynn said that he was considering investing in Revel, but he never made an official offer.

If Wynn buys Revel, it would be the second major purchase by the company in less than a year. In February, Wynn bought The Bellagio in Las Vegas from MGM Mirage for $1.6 billion.

Revel is currently owned by Morgan Stanley and other investors. The company has been trying to sell Revel since last year, but no offers have been accepted.

#  Caesars Entertainment Emerges as Frontrunner to Buy Revel Casino

Caesars Entertainment is among the frontrunners to purchase Atlantic City's Revel Casino, reports say.

The $2.4 billion casino has been struggling since it opened in 2012, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February.

Revel is reported to be seeking a buyer for $90 million or more.

Other potential buyers include The Seminole Tribe of Florida, which already owns two casinos in Atlantic City; Harrah's parent company Caesars Entertainment; and Boyd Gaming, which also has a presence in Atlantic City.

According to Reuters, a spokeswoman for Revel said the company had not yet approved any sale of the property.

Revel Casino was one of the most expensive casinos ever built, but has failed to live up to expectations due to its location away from the city's other casinos and a lack of amenities.

In its bankruptcy filing, Revel said it had lost over $1 billion since opening.

#  Brookfield Asset Management Eyeing a Bid for Revel Casino

Brookfield Asset Management is eyeing a bid for the Revel Casino in Atlantic City, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The move by Brookfield, a Toronto-based asset manager with more than $220 billion in assets, would come as Revel is struggling to stay afloat. The casino has been losing money since it opened in 2012 and recently missed a $10 million bond payment.

Revel's lenders are said to be urging the company to file for bankruptcy so they can recoup some of their investment. But Brookfield is hoping to buy Revel out of bankruptcy and operate it as a casino.

If Brookfield succeeds in its bid, it would become the latest in a series of buyers to take over an ailing Atlantic City casino. Borgata, Caesar's Entertainment, and Trump Entertainment all own casinos in Atlantic City that have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy at least once in recent years.

Atlantic City has been hit hard by competition from casinos in other states, most notably Pennsylvania and New York. In addition, the weak economy has kept many consumers away from casinos.

Brookfield declined to comment on the report.
