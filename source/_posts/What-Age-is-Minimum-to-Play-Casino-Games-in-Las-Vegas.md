#  What Age is Minimum to Play Casino Games in Las Vegas?

If you're wondering what the minimum age to gamble in Las Vegas is, it's 21. However, there are a few casinos that will allow 18-year-olds to gamble if they're accompanied by an adult.

#  You Must be 21 Years Old to Gamble in Las Vegas Casinos

In the state of Nevada, it’s required by law for casino-goers to be at least 21 years old. This law is in place to minimize gambling problems for minors and protect them from potential harm while gambling.

While the minimum age is 21, there is no maximum age. There have been cases of people who are well into their 90s still gambling in Las Vegas casinos.

The fine for gambling underage in a Nevada casino is $10,000. If you’re caught more than once, the penalties can be increased to up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine.

There are some exceptions to this rule, such as when someone under 21 is accompanied by a parent or guardian who is also gambling. In these cases, the minor is allowed to gamble as long as they are within sight of their adult companion at all times.

#  Can I Enter a Casino in Las Vegas at 18?

The minimum age for gambling in Nevada is 21 years old. However, there are a few casinos in Las Vegas that will allow you to gamble at 18. These casinos include the Eldorado, Silver Legacy and Circus Circus. If you are not of legal age, you can still gamble in Nevada, but your options are limited to the state's regulated sports betting and poker.

#  Minimum Age to Enter a Casino in Las Vegas is 21

As of September 1, 2009, the minimum age to enter a casino in Las Vegas is 21. The new law was enacted in an effort to combat problem gambling.

Previously, the minimum age to enter a casino in Las Vegas was 18. However, many casinos would allow younger guests into their premises if they were accompanied by an adult.

The new law not only increases the minimum age to 21, but also prohibits anyone under the age of 21 from loitering inside a casino. violators can face a misdemeanor charge and fines up to $1,000.

The move to increase the minimum age to 21 was met with mixed reactions from both casino operators and guests. While some welcomed the change as a way to help problem gamblers, others felt that it would discourage tourism to Las Vegas.

#  How Old do You Have to Be to Gamble in Las Vegas?

While there is no set age limit for gambling in Las Vegas, the Nevada Gaming Control Board stipulates that casino operators must not allow anyone younger than 21 years of age onto the gaming floor. The reason for this is because casino gaming is considered an adult activity and it is felt that those under 21 are not yet mature enough to handle the temptation and risks associated with gambling.

However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, those aged 18 or 19 can visit a casino as long as they are accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. There are also some casino games, such as slot machines, that can be played by those as young as 18. And finally, while you technically have to be over 21 to gamble in Las Vegas, there are plenty of casinos that will make an exception for someone who looks older than their years.

So, if you’re planning on visiting Sin City and you’re not quite old enough to gamble yet, don’t worry – you’ll still be able to enjoy all the other attractions that Las Vegas has to offer. Just be sure to pack your passport!
